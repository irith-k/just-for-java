# Just For Java
Just For Java is an educational website made by Irith and Irika Katiyar to teach Java programming in a relatable way. We provide lessons with blueprints to illustrate coding syntax, thorough explanations of key concepts, examples that we fully walk through, and practice problems through Replit so you can achieve mastery. To access the website, go to justforjava.com!

This website was made fully from scratch using React.js. We programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We use a Cloud Firestore Database on the backend for user authentication and storing user progress.

[Jan 2023] Update: due to a new CORS policy error that came up very recently, user progress is currently not being saved on the server side; we apologize for this inconvenience and are working to get it resolved as soon as possible.
