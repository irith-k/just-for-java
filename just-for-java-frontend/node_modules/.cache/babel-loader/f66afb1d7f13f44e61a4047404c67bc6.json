(<b className=\"note\">btw:</b> you may even see some jokes and text slang in there! *wink wink*) we provide <b>blueprints</b> to illustrate coding syntax and <b>examples</b> that we walk through so that you can master the concept. finally, coding is not only useful for computer scientists, but for <b>everyone</b>. oh, before we forget:\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"code\">\n\t\t\t\tall the code we write during our examples will go in a box like this one! ;)\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>omg! it do be time for our first terrible coding joke!</h3>\n\t\t\t\tcoding is:\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>10% coding</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>35% debugging</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>15% copy-and-pasted solutions</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>40% staring at the screen</li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\theheh. ok sry for killing one of ur brain cells...\n\t\t\t\t<h3>recap</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<b>yo guess what?!</b> you made it to recap! in <b>recap</b>, we give you a <b>sparknotes version</b> of what you learned – just a <b>lil summary</b> to help reinforce the coding concept. \n\t\t\t\tif you're ever still bamboozled about the concept – which is completely okay – don't hestiate to <b>email us</b>!
