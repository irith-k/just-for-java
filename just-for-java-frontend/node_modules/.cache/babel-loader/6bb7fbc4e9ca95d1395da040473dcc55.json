luckily for us, the <b>Math</b> library provides us with a variety of math constants and complex functions. let's take a look at all of the brand new and super cool functionality the <b>Math</b> library gives us! \n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t(<b className=\"note\">btw:</b> if you don't understand some of the mathematical concepts discussed below, that is <b>completely okay</b>. knowing every single aspect of the Math library isn't essential to your programming journey. the goal of talking about the Math library is simply to <b>add more tools into your programming toolbox</b>. you may never use some of the functionality, but you may use other functionality frequently.)\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you just want to eat some good pie</h3>\n\t\t\t\tlet's first talk about two <b>mathematical constants</b> that the Math library gives us access to: <b>pi</b> and <b>e</b>. (<b className=\"note\">btw:</b> just some quick definitions – pi is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.) here is the blueprint for <b>retrieving the double value of pi or e</b>:\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\tMath.PI\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tMath.E\n\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\tnow let's try to use this blueprint in code! create a program that creates a double variable to store the <b>radius</b> of a circle. then your program should create another double variable to store the <b>circumference</b> of the circle. (<b className=\"note\">hint:</b> the formula for the circumference of a circle is 2*pi*<i>r</i>, where <i>r</i> is the radius.)\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tyour program should look something like this:\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"code\">\n\t\t\t\tdouble radius = 3.0; <div className=\"comment\">//can be any value you want</div>\n\t\t\t\tdouble circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you maxed out your credit card on a shopping spree</h3>\n\t\t\t\tmax, min\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you have all the power in the world</h3>\n\t\t\t\tpow\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you're rooting for your favorite team</h3>\n\t\t\t\tsqrt, cbrt\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you wish you had a six pack</h3>\n\t\t\t\tabs\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you forgot everything you learned in trigonometry</h3>\n\t\t\t\tsin, cos, tan\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you're partying on the dance floor</h3>\n\t\t\t\tfloor\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you're lying in bed staring at the ceiling</h3>\n\t\t\t\tceil\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you're going round and round on the carousel</h3>\n\t\t\t\tround\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you want to buy everything in the mall</h3>\n\t\t\t\tthere is so much more cool and complex math functions you can utilize with the Math library! (<b className=\"note\">btw:</b> if you love trigonometry, the Math library has even more trig functions that you can play with.) unfortunately, we didn't have room to talk about everything in the Math library on this page, but <b>if you want to learn more about the Math library, simply search online</b>!\n\t\t\t\t<h3>when you realized you don't need to read more about the Math library</h3>\n\t\t\t\t<b>woohoo!</b> you made it to recap!\n\t\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t...we know <b className=\"note\">just for java</b> is as <b>addicting</b> as the newest Netflix binge, so what are you waiting for? <b className=\"pageName\">keep coding!</b>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default Mathematics;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
